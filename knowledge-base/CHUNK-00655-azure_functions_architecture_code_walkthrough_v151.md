# Azure Functions Architecture — Code Walkthrough (v151)

## Problem

When integrating with legacy systems, **Problem** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (code_walkthrough). This variant 151 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS azure_151 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 151,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_azure_151_topic ON azure_151 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM azure_151
WHERE topic = 'azure_functions' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
