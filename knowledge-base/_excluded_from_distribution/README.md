# Excluded from Commercial Distribution

Files in this directory are **not** included in the Coltex Product package
(`make product`) and must not be shipped in commercial releases.

## Why excluded

These documents are procedural placeholder stubs generated from templates.
They contain a single boilerplate paragraph and do not constitute substantive
original documentation suitable for commercial distribution.

Example marker:

> "This document provides detailed information on … as it relates to the
> Coltex Enterprise AI Coding Chatbot …"

## License status

These files remain Apache-2.0 licensed (see `knowledge-base/LICENSE`) but are
quarantined because they do not meet product quality standards — not because of
third-party copyright concerns.
