# Google Cloud Run Services — Code Walkthrough (v160)

## Problem

In practice, **Problem** for `Google Cloud Run Services` (code_walkthrough). This variant 160 covers cloud_run, gke, iam, autoscaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
