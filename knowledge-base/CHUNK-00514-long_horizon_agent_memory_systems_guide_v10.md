# Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems — Guide (v10)

## Overview

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Overview** for `Long-Horizon Agent Memory Systems` (guide). This variant 10 covers episodic, semantic, working_memory, summarization at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface AgentMemoryConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleAgentMemory(config: AgentMemoryConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
