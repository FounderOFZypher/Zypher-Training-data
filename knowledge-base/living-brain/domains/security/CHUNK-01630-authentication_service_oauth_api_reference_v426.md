# Authentication Service: OAuth — Api Reference (v426)

## Endpoint

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Endpoint** for `Authentication Service: OAuth` (api_reference). This variant 426 covers auth_service, oauth, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Authentication** for `Authentication Service: OAuth` (api_reference). This variant 426 covers auth_service, oauth, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Request Schema** for `Authentication Service: OAuth` (api_reference). This variant 426 covers auth_service, oauth, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS security_426 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 426,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_security_426_topic ON security_426 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM security_426
WHERE topic = 'auth_service_oauth' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
