# mTLS for Internal Service Mesh — Api Reference (v264)

## Endpoint

In practice, **Endpoint** for `mTLS for Internal Service Mesh` (api_reference). This variant 264 covers mtls, istio, certificates, mesh at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

In practice, **Authentication** for `mTLS for Internal Service Mesh` (api_reference). This variant 264 covers mtls, istio, certificates, mesh at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

In practice, **Request Schema** for `mTLS for Internal Service Mesh` (api_reference). This variant 264 covers mtls, istio, certificates, mesh at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

In practice, **Response Schema** for `mTLS for Internal Service Mesh` (api_reference). This variant 264 covers mtls, istio, certificates, mesh at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class MtlsInternal:
    """mTLS for Internal Service Mesh"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "mtls_internal", "variant": 264}
```
