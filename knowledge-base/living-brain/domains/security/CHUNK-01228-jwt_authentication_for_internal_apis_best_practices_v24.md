# JWT Authentication for Internal APIs — Best Practices (v24)

## Principles

In practice, **Principles** for `JWT Authentication for Internal APIs` (best_practices). This variant 24 covers jwt, oauth, rbac, tokens at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
