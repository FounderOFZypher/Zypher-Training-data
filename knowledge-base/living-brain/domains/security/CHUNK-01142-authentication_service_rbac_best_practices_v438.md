# Authentication Service: RBAC — Best Practices (v438)

## Principles

For security-sensitive deployments, **Principles** for `Authentication Service: RBAC` (best_practices). This variant 438 covers auth_service, rbac, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

For security-sensitive deployments, **Do** for `Authentication Service: RBAC` (best_practices). This variant 438 covers auth_service, rbac, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

For security-sensitive deployments, **Don't** for `Authentication Service: RBAC` (best_practices). This variant 438 covers auth_service, rbac, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Checklist

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS security_438 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 438,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_security_438_topic ON security_438 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM security_438
WHERE topic = 'auth_service_rbac' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
