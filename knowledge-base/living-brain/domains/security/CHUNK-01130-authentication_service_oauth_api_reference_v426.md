# Authentication Service: OAuth — Api Reference (v426)

## Endpoint

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Endpoint** for `Authentication Service: OAuth` (api_reference). This variant 426 covers auth_service, oauth, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Authentication** for `Authentication Service: OAuth` (api_reference). This variant 426 covers auth_service, oauth, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Request Schema** for `Authentication Service: OAuth` (api_reference). This variant 426 covers auth_service, oauth, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Response Schema** for `Authentication Service: OAuth` (api_reference). This variant 426 covers auth_service, oauth, security at intermediate level.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface AuthServiceOauthConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleAuthServiceOauth(config: AuthServiceOauthConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
