# Authentication Service: RBAC — Benchmark (v440)

## Suite

In practice, **Suite** for `Authentication Service: RBAC` (benchmark). This variant 440 covers auth_service, rbac, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

In practice, **Methodology** for `Authentication Service: RBAC` (benchmark). This variant 440 covers auth_service, rbac, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

In practice, **Dataset** for `Authentication Service: RBAC` (benchmark). This variant 440 covers auth_service, rbac, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Authentication Service: RBAC benchmark variant 440.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.72 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 6720 |
| error rate | 0.4410 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS security_440 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 440,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_security_440_topic ON security_440 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM security_440
WHERE topic = 'auth_service_rbac' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
