# PII Detection in Code Repositories — Guide (v388)

## Overview

Under high load, **Overview** for `PII Detection in Code Repositories` (guide). This variant 388 covers pii, redaction, scanning, compliance at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS security_388 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 388,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_security_388_topic ON security_388 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM security_388
WHERE topic = 'pii_detection' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
