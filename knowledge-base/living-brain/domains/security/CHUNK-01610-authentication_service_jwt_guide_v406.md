# Authentication Service: JWT — Guide (v406)

## Overview

For security-sensitive deployments, **Overview** for `Authentication Service: JWT` (guide). This variant 406 covers auth_service, jwt, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
