# mTLS for Internal Service Mesh — Code Walkthrough (v268)

## Problem

Under high load, **Problem** for `mTLS for Internal Service Mesh` (code_walkthrough). This variant 268 covers mtls, istio, certificates, mesh at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface MtlsInternalConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleMtlsInternal(config: MtlsInternalConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
