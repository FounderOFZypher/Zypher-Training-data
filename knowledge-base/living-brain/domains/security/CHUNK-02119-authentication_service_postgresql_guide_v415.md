# Authentication Service: PostgreSQL — Guide (v415)

## Overview

When integrating with legacy systems, **Overview** for `Authentication Service: PostgreSQL` (guide). This variant 415 covers auth_service, postgresql, security at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Prerequisites

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS security_415 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 415,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_security_415_topic ON security_415 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM security_415
WHERE topic = 'auth_service_postgresql' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
