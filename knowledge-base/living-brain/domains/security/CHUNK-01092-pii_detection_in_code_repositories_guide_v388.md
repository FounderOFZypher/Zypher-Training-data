# PII Detection in Code Repositories — Guide (v388)

## Overview

Under high load, **Overview** for `PII Detection in Code Repositories` (guide). This variant 388 covers pii, redaction, scanning, compliance at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class PiiDetection:
    """PII Detection in Code Repositories"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "pii_detection", "variant": 388}
```
