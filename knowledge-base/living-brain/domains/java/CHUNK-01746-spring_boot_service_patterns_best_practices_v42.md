# Spring Boot Service Patterns — Best Practices (v42)

## Principles

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Principles** for `Spring Boot Service Patterns` (best_practices). This variant 42 covers spring, dependency_injection, rest, testing at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Do** for `Spring Boot Service Patterns` (best_practices). This variant 42 covers spring, dependency_injection, rest, testing at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Don't** for `Spring Boot Service Patterns` (best_practices). This variant 42 covers spring, dependency_injection, rest, testing at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```java
public class JavaSpring {
    private final String topic = "java_spring";
    private final int variant = 42;

    public Record<String, Object> process(Map<String, Object> payload) {
        return Map.of("status", "ok", "topic", topic, "variant", variant);
    }
}
```
