# Docker Compose for Local Dev — Code Walkthrough (v124)

## Problem

Under high load, **Problem** for `Docker Compose for Local Dev` (code_walkthrough). This variant 124 covers compose, volumes, networks, healthchecks at beginner level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
