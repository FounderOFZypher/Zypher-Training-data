# GraphRAG Engine: Traversal — Best Practices (v474)

## Principles

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Principles** for `GraphRAG Engine: Traversal` (best_practices). This variant 474 covers graphrag_engine, traversal, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Do** for `GraphRAG Engine: Traversal` (best_practices). This variant 474 covers graphrag_engine, traversal, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Don't** for `GraphRAG Engine: Traversal` (best_practices). This variant 474 covers graphrag_engine, traversal, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
