# GraphRAG Engine: Vector Search — Benchmark (v485)

## Suite

During incident response, **Suite** for `GraphRAG Engine: Vector Search` (benchmark). This variant 485 covers graphrag_engine, vector search, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

During incident response, **Methodology** for `GraphRAG Engine: Vector Search` (benchmark). This variant 485 covers graphrag_engine, vector search, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

During incident response, **Dataset** for `GraphRAG Engine: Vector Search` (benchmark). This variant 485 covers graphrag_engine, vector search, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — GraphRAG Engine: Vector Search benchmark variant 485.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.82 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 7395 |
