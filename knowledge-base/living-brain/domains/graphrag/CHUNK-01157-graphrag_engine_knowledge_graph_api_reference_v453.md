# GraphRAG Engine: Knowledge Graph — Api Reference (v453)

## Endpoint

During incident response, **Endpoint** for `GraphRAG Engine: Knowledge Graph` (api_reference). This variant 453 covers graphrag_engine, knowledge graph, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

During incident response, **Authentication** for `GraphRAG Engine: Knowledge Graph` (api_reference). This variant 453 covers graphrag_engine, knowledge graph, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

```typescript
interface GraphragEngineKnowledgeGraphConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleGraphragEngineKnowledgeGraph(config: GraphragEngineKnowledgeGraphConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
