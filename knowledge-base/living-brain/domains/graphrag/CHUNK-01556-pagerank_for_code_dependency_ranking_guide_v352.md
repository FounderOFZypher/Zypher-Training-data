# PageRank for Code Dependency Ranking — Guide (v352)

## Overview

In practice, **Overview** for `PageRank for Code Dependency Ranking` (guide). This variant 352 covers pagerank, dependencies, ranking, impact at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
