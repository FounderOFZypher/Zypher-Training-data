# GraphRAG Engine: AST Parser — Api Reference (v462)

## Endpoint

For security-sensitive deployments, **Endpoint** for `GraphRAG Engine: AST Parser` (api_reference). This variant 462 covers graphrag_engine, ast parser, graphrag at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

```typescript
interface GraphragEngineAstParserConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleGraphragEngineAstParser(config: GraphragEngineAstParserConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
