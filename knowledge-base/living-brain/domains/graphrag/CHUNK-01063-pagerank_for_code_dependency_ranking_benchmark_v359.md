# PageRank for Code Dependency Ranking — Benchmark (v359)

## Suite

When integrating with legacy systems, **Suite** for `PageRank for Code Dependency Ranking` (benchmark). This variant 359 covers pagerank, dependencies, ranking, impact at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

When integrating with legacy systems, **Methodology** for `PageRank for Code Dependency Ranking` (benchmark). This variant 359 covers pagerank, dependencies, ranking, impact at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

When integrating with legacy systems, **Dataset** for `PageRank for Code Dependency Ranking` (benchmark). This variant 359 covers pagerank, dependencies, ranking, impact at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — PageRank for Code Dependency Ranking benchmark variant 359.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.90 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 5505 |
| error rate | 0.3600 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.
