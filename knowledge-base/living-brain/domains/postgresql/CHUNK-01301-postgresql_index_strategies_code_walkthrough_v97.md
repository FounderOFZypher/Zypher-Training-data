# PostgreSQL Index Strategies — Code Walkthrough (v97)

## Problem

For production systems, **Problem** for `PostgreSQL Index Strategies` (code_walkthrough). This variant 97 covers btree, gin, partial_index, vacuum at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS postgresql_97 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 97,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_postgresql_97_topic ON postgresql_97 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM postgresql_97
WHERE topic = 'postgres_indexing' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
