# Payment Processing Service: Stripe API — Code Walkthrough (v493)

## Problem

During incident response, **Problem** for `Payment Processing Service: Stripe API` (code_walkthrough). This variant 493 covers payment_service, stripe api, microservices at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class PaymentServiceStripeApi:
    """Payment Processing Service: Stripe API"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "payment_service_stripe_api", "variant": 493}
```
