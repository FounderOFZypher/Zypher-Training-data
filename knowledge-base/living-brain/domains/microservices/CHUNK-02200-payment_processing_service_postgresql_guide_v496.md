# Payment Processing Service: PostgreSQL — Guide (v496)

## Overview

In practice, **Overview** for `Payment Processing Service: PostgreSQL` (guide). This variant 496 covers payment_service, postgresql, microservices at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class PaymentServicePostgresql:
    """Payment Processing Service: PostgreSQL"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "payment_service_postgresql", "variant": 496}
```
