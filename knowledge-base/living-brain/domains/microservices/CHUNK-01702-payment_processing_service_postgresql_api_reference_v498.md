# Payment Processing Service: PostgreSQL — Api Reference (v498)

## Endpoint

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Endpoint** for `Payment Processing Service: PostgreSQL` (api_reference). This variant 498 covers payment_service, postgresql, microservices at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

```typescript
interface PaymentServicePostgresqlConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handlePaymentServicePostgresql(config: PaymentServicePostgresqlConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
