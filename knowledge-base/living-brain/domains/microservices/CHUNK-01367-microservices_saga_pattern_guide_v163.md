# Microservices Saga Pattern — Guide (v163)

## Overview

From first principles, **Overview** for `Microservices Saga Pattern` (guide). This variant 163 covers saga, compensation, orchestration, choreography at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface MicroservicesSagaConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleMicroservicesSaga(config: MicroservicesSagaConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
