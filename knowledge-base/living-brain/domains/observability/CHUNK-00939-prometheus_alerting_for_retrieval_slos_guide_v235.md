# Prometheus Alerting for Retrieval SLOs — Guide (v235)

## Overview

From first principles, **Overview** for `Prometheus Alerting for Retrieval SLOs` (guide). This variant 235 covers prometheus, alertmanager, slo, burn_rate at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
