# Grafana Dashboards for RAG Metrics — Code Walkthrough (v250)

## Problem

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Problem** for `Grafana Dashboards for RAG Metrics` (code_walkthrough). This variant 250 covers grafana, dashboards, latency, recall at beginner level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS observability_250 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 250,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_observability_250_topic ON observability_250 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM observability_250
WHERE topic = 'grafana_dashboards' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
