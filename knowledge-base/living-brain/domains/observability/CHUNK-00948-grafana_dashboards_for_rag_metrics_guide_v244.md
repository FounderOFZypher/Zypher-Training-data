# Grafana Dashboards for RAG Metrics — Guide (v244)

## Overview

Under high load, **Overview** for `Grafana Dashboards for RAG Metrics` (guide). This variant 244 covers grafana, dashboards, latency, recall at beginner level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class GrafanaDashboards:
    """Grafana Dashboards for RAG Metrics"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "grafana_dashboards", "variant": 244}
```
