# Grafana Dashboards for RAG Metrics — Benchmark (v251)

## Suite

From first principles, **Suite** for `Grafana Dashboards for RAG Metrics` (benchmark). This variant 251 covers grafana, dashboards, latency, recall at beginner level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

From first principles, **Methodology** for `Grafana Dashboards for RAG Metrics` (benchmark). This variant 251 covers grafana, dashboards, latency, recall at beginner level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

From first principles, **Dataset** for `Grafana Dashboards for RAG Metrics` (benchmark). This variant 251 covers grafana, dashboards, latency, recall at beginner level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Grafana Dashboards for RAG Metrics benchmark variant 251.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.74 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 3885 |
| error rate | 0.2520 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.
