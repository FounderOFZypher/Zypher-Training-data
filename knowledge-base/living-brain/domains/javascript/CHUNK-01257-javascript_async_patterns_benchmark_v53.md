# JavaScript Async Patterns — Benchmark (v53)

## Suite

During incident response, **Suite** for `JavaScript Async Patterns` (benchmark). This variant 53 covers promises, async_await, event_loop, fetch at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

During incident response, **Methodology** for `JavaScript Async Patterns` (benchmark). This variant 53 covers promises, async_await, event_loop, fetch at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

During incident response, **Dataset** for `JavaScript Async Patterns` (benchmark). This variant 53 covers promises, async_await, event_loop, fetch at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — JavaScript Async Patterns benchmark variant 53.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.78 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 915 |
| error rate | 0.0540 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Comparison

During incident response, **Comparison** for `JavaScript Async Patterns` (benchmark). This variant 53 covers promises, async_await, event_loop, fetch at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```javascript
export async function handleJsPromises(config) {
  const { topic = "js_promises", variant = 53 } = config;
  return { status: "ok", topic, variant };
}
```
