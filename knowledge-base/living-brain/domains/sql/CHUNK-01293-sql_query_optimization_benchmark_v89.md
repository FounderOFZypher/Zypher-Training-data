# SQL Query Optimization — Benchmark (v89)

## Suite

For production systems, **Suite** for `SQL Query Optimization` (benchmark). This variant 89 covers indexes, explain, joins, partitioning at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

For production systems, **Methodology** for `SQL Query Optimization` (benchmark). This variant 89 covers indexes, explain, joins, partitioning at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

For production systems, **Dataset** for `SQL Query Optimization` (benchmark). This variant 89 covers indexes, explain, joins, partitioning at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — SQL Query Optimization benchmark variant 89.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.90 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 1455 |
| error rate | 0.0900 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sql_89 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 89,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sql_89_topic ON sql_89 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM sql_89
WHERE topic = 'sql_optimization' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
