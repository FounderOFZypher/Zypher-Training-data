# Cost Optimization for Embedding Pipelines — Best Practices (v375)

## Principles

When integrating with legacy systems, **Principles** for `Cost Optimization for Embedding Pipelines` (best_practices). This variant 375 covers batching, caching, gpu, cost at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

When integrating with legacy systems, **Do** for `Cost Optimization for Embedding Pipelines` (best_practices). This variant 375 covers batching, caching, gpu, cost at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

When integrating with legacy systems, **Don't** for `Cost Optimization for Embedding Pipelines` (best_practices). This variant 375 covers batching, caching, gpu, cost at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
