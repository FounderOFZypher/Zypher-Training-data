# Load Testing RAG Inference Endpoints — Guide (v361)

## Overview

For production systems, **Overview** for `Load Testing RAG Inference Endpoints` (guide). This variant 361 covers k6, locust, throughput, latency at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Prerequisites

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS performance_361 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 361,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_performance_361_topic ON performance_361 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM performance_361
WHERE topic = 'load_testing' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
