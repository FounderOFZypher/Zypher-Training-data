# Cost Optimization for Embedding Pipelines — Guide (v370)

## Overview

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Overview** for `Cost Optimization for Embedding Pipelines` (guide). This variant 370 covers batching, caching, gpu, cost at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
