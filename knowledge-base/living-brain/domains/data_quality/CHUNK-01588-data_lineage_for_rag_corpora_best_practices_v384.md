# Data Lineage for RAG Corpora — Best Practices (v384)

## Principles

In practice, **Principles** for `Data Lineage for RAG Corpora` (best_practices). This variant 384 covers lineage, provenance, audit, versioning at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

In practice, **Do** for `Data Lineage for RAG Corpora` (best_practices). This variant 384 covers lineage, provenance, audit, versioning at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS data_quality_384 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 384,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_data_quality_384_topic ON data_quality_384 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM data_quality_384
WHERE topic = 'data_lineage' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
