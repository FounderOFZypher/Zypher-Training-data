# Data Lineage for RAG Corpora — Best Practices (v384)

## Principles

In practice, **Principles** for `Data Lineage for RAG Corpora` (best_practices). This variant 384 covers lineage, provenance, audit, versioning at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
