# Async Python for High-Throughput Pipelines — Benchmark (v35)

## Suite

From first principles, **Suite** for `Async Python for High-Throughput Pipelines` (benchmark). This variant 35 covers asyncio, aiohttp, concurrency, queues at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

From first principles, **Methodology** for `Async Python for High-Throughput Pipelines` (benchmark). This variant 35 covers asyncio, aiohttp, concurrency, queues at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes.

## Dataset

From first principles, **Dataset** for `Async Python for High-Throughput Pipelines` (benchmark). This variant 35 covers asyncio, aiohttp, concurrency, queues at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Async Python for High-Throughput Pipelines benchmark variant 35.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.82 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 645 |
| error rate | 0.0360 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class AsyncPython:
    """Async Python for High-Throughput Pipelines"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "async_python", "variant": 35}
```
