# Advanced TypeScript Generics — Best Practices (v60)

## Principles

Under high load, **Principles** for `Advanced TypeScript Generics` (best_practices). This variant 60 covers generics, utility_types, inference, constraints at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

Under high load, **Do** for `Advanced TypeScript Generics` (best_practices). This variant 60 covers generics, utility_types, inference, constraints at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

Under high load, **Don't** for `Advanced TypeScript Generics` (best_practices). This variant 60 covers generics, utility_types, inference, constraints at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface TsGenericsConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleTsGenerics(config: TsGenericsConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
