# Advanced TypeScript Generics — Guide (v55)

## Overview

When integrating with legacy systems, **Overview** for `Advanced TypeScript Generics` (guide). This variant 55 covers generics, utility_types, inference, constraints at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Prerequisites

When integrating with legacy systems, **Prerequisites** for `Advanced TypeScript Generics` (guide). This variant 55 covers generics, utility_types, inference, constraints at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Core Concepts

## Validation

When integrating with legacy systems, **Validation** for `Advanced TypeScript Generics` (guide). This variant 55 covers generics, utility_types, inference, constraints at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Next Steps

When integrating with legacy systems, **Next Steps** for `Advanced TypeScript Generics` (guide). This variant 55 covers generics, utility_types, inference, constraints at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface TsGenericsConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleTsGenerics(config: TsGenericsConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
