# Blameless Postmortem Writing — Best Practices (v186)

## Principles

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Principles** for `Blameless Postmortem Writing` (best_practices). This variant 186 covers timeline, root_cause, action_items, lessons at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
