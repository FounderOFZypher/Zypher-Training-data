# Blameless Postmortem Writing — Benchmark (v188)

## Suite

Under high load, **Suite** for `Blameless Postmortem Writing` (benchmark). This variant 188 covers timeline, root_cause, action_items, lessons at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

Under high load, **Methodology** for `Blameless Postmortem Writing` (benchmark). This variant 188 covers timeline, root_cause, action_items, lessons at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

Under high load, **Dataset** for `Blameless Postmortem Writing` (benchmark). This variant 188 covers timeline, root_cause, action_items, lessons at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Blameless Postmortem Writing benchmark variant 188.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.88 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 2940 |
| error rate | 0.1890 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class Postmortem:
    """Blameless Postmortem Writing"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "postmortem", "variant": 188}
```
