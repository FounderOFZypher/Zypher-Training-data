# Azure Functions Architecture — Api Reference (v147)

## Endpoint

From first principles, **Endpoint** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (api_reference). This variant 147 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

From first principles, **Authentication** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (api_reference). This variant 147 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

From first principles, **Request Schema** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (api_reference). This variant 147 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

From first principles, **Response Schema** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (api_reference). This variant 147 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Error Codes

From first principles, **Error Codes** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (api_reference). This variant 147 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class AzureFunctions:
    """Azure Functions Architecture"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "azure_functions", "variant": 147}
```
