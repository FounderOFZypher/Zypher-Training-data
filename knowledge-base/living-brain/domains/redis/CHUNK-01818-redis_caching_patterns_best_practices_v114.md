# Redis Caching Patterns — Best Practices (v114)

## Principles

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Principles** for `Redis Caching Patterns` (best_practices). This variant 114 covers cache_aside, ttl, pub_sub, lua at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Do** for `Redis Caching Patterns` (best_practices). This variant 114 covers cache_aside, ttl, pub_sub, lua at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Don't** for `Redis Caching Patterns` (best_practices). This variant 114 covers cache_aside, ttl, pub_sub, lua at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
