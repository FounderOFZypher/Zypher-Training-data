# ReAct Agent Pattern for Tool Use — Best Practices (v339)

## Principles

From first principles, **Principles** for `ReAct Agent Pattern for Tool Use` (best_practices). This variant 339 covers react, reasoning, acting, tools at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface ReactPatternConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleReactPattern(config: ReactPatternConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
