# ReAct Agent Pattern for Tool Use — Code Walkthrough (v340)

## Problem

Under high load, **Problem** for `ReAct Agent Pattern for Tool Use` (code_walkthrough). This variant 340 covers react, reasoning, acting, tools at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
