# ReAct Agent Pattern for Tool Use — Benchmark (v341)

## Suite

During incident response, **Suite** for `ReAct Agent Pattern for Tool Use` (benchmark). This variant 341 covers react, reasoning, acting, tools at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

During incident response, **Methodology** for `ReAct Agent Pattern for Tool Use` (benchmark). This variant 341 covers react, reasoning, acting, tools at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

During incident response, **Dataset** for `ReAct Agent Pattern for Tool Use` (benchmark). This variant 341 covers react, reasoning, acting, tools at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — ReAct Agent Pattern for Tool Use benchmark variant 341.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.74 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 5235 |
| error rate | 0.3420 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.
