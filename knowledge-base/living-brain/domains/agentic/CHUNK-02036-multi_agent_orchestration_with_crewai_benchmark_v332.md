# Multi-Agent Orchestration with CrewAI — Benchmark (v332)

## Suite

Under high load, **Suite** for `Multi-Agent Orchestration with CrewAI` (benchmark). This variant 332 covers crewai, agents, tasks, delegation at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

Under high load, **Methodology** for `Multi-Agent Orchestration with CrewAI` (benchmark). This variant 332 covers crewai, agents, tasks, delegation at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

Under high load, **Dataset** for `Multi-Agent Orchestration with CrewAI` (benchmark). This variant 332 covers crewai, agents, tasks, delegation at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes.
