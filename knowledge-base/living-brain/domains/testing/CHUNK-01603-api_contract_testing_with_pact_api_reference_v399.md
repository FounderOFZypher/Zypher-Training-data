# API Contract Testing with Pact — Api Reference (v399)

## Endpoint

When integrating with legacy systems, **Endpoint** for `API Contract Testing with Pact` (api_reference). This variant 399 covers pact, contracts, consumer, provider at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

When integrating with legacy systems, **Authentication** for `API Contract Testing with Pact` (api_reference). This variant 399 covers pact, contracts, consumer, provider at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
