# API Contract Testing with Pact — Guide (v397)

## Overview

During incident response, **Overview** for `API Contract Testing with Pact` (guide). This variant 397 covers pact, contracts, consumer, provider at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface ContractTestingConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleContractTesting(config: ContractTestingConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
