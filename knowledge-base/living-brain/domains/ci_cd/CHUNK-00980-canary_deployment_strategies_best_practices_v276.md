# Canary Deployment Strategies — Best Practices (v276)

## Principles

Under high load, **Principles** for `Canary Deployment Strategies` (best_practices). This variant 276 covers canary, rollout, traffic_split, rollback at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

Under high load, **Do** for `Canary Deployment Strategies` (best_practices). This variant 276 covers canary, rollout, traffic_split, rollback at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

Under high load, **Don't** for `Canary Deployment Strategies` (best_practices). This variant 276 covers canary, rollout, traffic_split, rollback at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ci_cd_276 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 276,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_ci_cd_276_topic ON ci_cd_276 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM ci_cd_276
WHERE topic = 'canary_deploy' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
