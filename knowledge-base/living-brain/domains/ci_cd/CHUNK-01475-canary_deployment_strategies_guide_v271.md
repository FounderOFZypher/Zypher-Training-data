# Canary Deployment Strategies — Guide (v271)

## Overview

When integrating with legacy systems, **Overview** for `Canary Deployment Strategies` (guide). This variant 271 covers canary, rollout, traffic_split, rollback at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Prerequisites

When integrating with legacy systems, **Prerequisites** for `Canary Deployment Strategies` (guide). This variant 271 covers canary, rollout, traffic_split, rollback at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ci_cd_271 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 271,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_ci_cd_271_topic ON ci_cd_271 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM ci_cd_271
WHERE topic = 'canary_deploy' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
