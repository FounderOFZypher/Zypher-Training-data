# Feature Flag Rollout Patterns — Code Walkthrough (v286)

## Problem

For security-sensitive deployments, **Problem** for `Feature Flag Rollout Patterns` (code_walkthrough). This variant 286 covers feature_flags, launchdarkly, rollout, kill_switch at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
