# Cross-Encoder Reranking for RAG — Code Walkthrough (v205)

## Problem

During incident response, **Problem** for `Cross-Encoder Reranking for RAG` (code_walkthrough). This variant 205 covers cross_encoder, reranking, bi_encoder, fusion at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS rag_205 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 205,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_rag_205_topic ON rag_205 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM rag_205
WHERE topic = 'hybrid_reranking' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
