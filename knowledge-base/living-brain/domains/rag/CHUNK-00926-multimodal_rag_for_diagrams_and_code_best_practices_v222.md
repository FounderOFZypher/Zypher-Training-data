# Multimodal RAG for Diagrams and Code — Best Practices (v222)

## Principles

For security-sensitive deployments, **Principles** for `Multimodal RAG for Diagrams and Code` (best_practices). This variant 222 covers vision, diagrams, screenshots, multimodal at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

For security-sensitive deployments, **Do** for `Multimodal RAG for Diagrams and Code` (best_practices). This variant 222 covers vision, diagrams, screenshots, multimodal at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

For security-sensitive deployments, **Don't** for `Multimodal RAG for Diagrams and Code` (best_practices). This variant 222 covers vision, diagrams, screenshots, multimodal at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class MultimodalRag:
    """Multimodal RAG for Diagrams and Code"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "multimodal_rag", "variant": 222}
```
