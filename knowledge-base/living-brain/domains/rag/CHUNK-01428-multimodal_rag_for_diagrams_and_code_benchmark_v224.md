# Multimodal RAG for Diagrams and Code — Benchmark (v224)

## Suite

In practice, **Suite** for `Multimodal RAG for Diagrams and Code` (benchmark). This variant 224 covers vision, diagrams, screenshots, multimodal at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

In practice, **Methodology** for `Multimodal RAG for Diagrams and Code` (benchmark). This variant 224 covers vision, diagrams, screenshots, multimodal at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

In practice, **Dataset** for `Multimodal RAG for Diagrams and Code` (benchmark). This variant 224 covers vision, diagrams, screenshots, multimodal at expert level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Multimodal RAG for Diagrams and Code benchmark variant 224.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.80 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 3480 |
| error rate | 0.2250 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.
