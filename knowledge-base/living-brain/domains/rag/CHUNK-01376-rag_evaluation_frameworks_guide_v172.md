# RAG Evaluation Frameworks — Guide (v172)

## Overview

Under high load, **Overview** for `RAG Evaluation Frameworks` (guide). This variant 172 covers faithfulness, relevance, ragas, benchmarks at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface RagEvalConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleRagEval(config: RagEvalConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
