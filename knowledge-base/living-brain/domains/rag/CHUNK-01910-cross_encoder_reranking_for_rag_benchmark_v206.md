# Cross-Encoder Reranking for RAG — Benchmark (v206)

## Suite

For security-sensitive deployments, **Suite** for `Cross-Encoder Reranking for RAG` (benchmark). This variant 206 covers cross_encoder, reranking, bi_encoder, fusion at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology
