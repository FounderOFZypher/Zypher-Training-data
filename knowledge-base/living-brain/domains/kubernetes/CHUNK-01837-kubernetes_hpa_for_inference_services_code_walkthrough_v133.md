# Kubernetes HPA for Inference Services — Code Walkthrough (v133)

## Problem

During incident response, **Problem** for `Kubernetes HPA for Inference Services` (code_walkthrough). This variant 133 covers hpa, autoscaling, gpu, serving at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
