# Kubernetes HPA for Inference Services — Benchmark (v134)

## Suite

For security-sensitive deployments, **Suite** for `Kubernetes HPA for Inference Services` (benchmark). This variant 134 covers hpa, autoscaling, gpu, serving at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

## Dataset

For security-sensitive deployments, **Dataset** for `Kubernetes HPA for Inference Services` (benchmark). This variant 134 covers hpa, autoscaling, gpu, serving at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Kubernetes HPA for Inference Services benchmark variant 134.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.80 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 2130 |
| error rate | 0.1350 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.
