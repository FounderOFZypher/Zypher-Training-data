# Go Concurrency Patterns — Benchmark (v71)

## Suite

When integrating with legacy systems, **Suite** for `Go Concurrency Patterns` (benchmark). This variant 71 covers goroutines, channels, select, worker_pools at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

When integrating with legacy systems, **Methodology** for `Go Concurrency Patterns` (benchmark). This variant 71 covers goroutines, channels, select, worker_pools at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

When integrating with legacy systems, **Dataset** for `Go Concurrency Patterns` (benchmark). This variant 71 covers goroutines, channels, select, worker_pools at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Go Concurrency Patterns benchmark variant 71.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.74 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 1185 |
| error rate | 0.0720 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```go
package main

type GoConcurrency struct {
    Topic   string
    Variant int
}

func (s *GoConcurrency) Process() map[string]interface{} {
    return map[string]interface{}{"status": "ok", "topic": "go_concurrency", "variant": 71}
}
```
