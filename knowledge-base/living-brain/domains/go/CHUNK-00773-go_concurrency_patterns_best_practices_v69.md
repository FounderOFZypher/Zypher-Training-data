# Go Concurrency Patterns — Best Practices (v69)

## Principles

During incident response, **Principles** for `Go Concurrency Patterns` (best_practices). This variant 69 covers goroutines, channels, select, worker_pools at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

During incident response, **Do** for `Go Concurrency Patterns` (best_practices). This variant 69 covers goroutines, channels, select, worker_pools at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

During incident response, **Don't** for `Go Concurrency Patterns` (best_practices). This variant 69 covers goroutines, channels, select, worker_pools at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Checklist

Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes.

## Reference Implementation

```go
package main

type GoConcurrency struct {
    Topic   string
    Variant int
}

func (s *GoConcurrency) Process() map[string]interface{} {
    return map[string]interface{}{"status": "ok", "topic": "go_concurrency", "variant": 69}
}
```
