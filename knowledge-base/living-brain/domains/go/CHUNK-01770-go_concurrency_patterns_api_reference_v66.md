# Go Concurrency Patterns — Api Reference (v66)

## Endpoint

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Endpoint** for `Go Concurrency Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 66 covers goroutines, channels, select, worker_pools at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Authentication** for `Go Concurrency Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 66 covers goroutines, channels, select, worker_pools at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Request Schema** for `Go Concurrency Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 66 covers goroutines, channels, select, worker_pools at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Response Schema** for `Go Concurrency Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 66 covers goroutines, channels, select, worker_pools at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Error Codes

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Error Codes** for `Go Concurrency Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 66 covers goroutines, channels, select, worker_pools at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```go
package main

type GoConcurrency struct {
    Topic   string
    Variant int
}

func (s *GoConcurrency) Process() map[string]interface{} {
    return map[string]interface{}{"status": "ok", "topic": "go_concurrency", "variant": 66}
}
```
