# LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning — Benchmark (v197)

## Suite

During incident response, **Suite** for `LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning` (benchmark). This variant 197 covers lora, qlora, peft, sft at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

During incident response, **Methodology** for `LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning` (benchmark). This variant 197 covers lora, qlora, peft, sft at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

During incident response, **Dataset** for `LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning` (benchmark). This variant 197 covers lora, qlora, peft, sft at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning benchmark variant 197.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.86 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 3075 |
| error rate | 0.1980 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.
