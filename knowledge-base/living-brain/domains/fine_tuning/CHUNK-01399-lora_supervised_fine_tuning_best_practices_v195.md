# LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning — Best Practices (v195)

## Principles

From first principles, **Principles** for `LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning` (best_practices). This variant 195 covers lora, qlora, peft, sft at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

From first principles, **Do** for `LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning` (best_practices). This variant 195 covers lora, qlora, peft, sft at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

From first principles, **Don't** for `LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning` (best_practices). This variant 195 covers lora, qlora, peft, sft at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes.

## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS fine_tuning_195 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 195,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_fine_tuning_195_topic ON fine_tuning_195 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM fine_tuning_195
WHERE topic = 'lora_sft' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
