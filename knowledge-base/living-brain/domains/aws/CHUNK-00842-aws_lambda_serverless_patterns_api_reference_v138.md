# AWS Lambda Serverless Patterns — Api Reference (v138)

## Endpoint

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Endpoint** for `AWS Lambda Serverless Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 138 covers lambda, api_gateway, iam, cold_start at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Authentication

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Authentication** for `AWS Lambda Serverless Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 138 covers lambda, api_gateway, iam, cold_start at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Request Schema

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Request Schema** for `AWS Lambda Serverless Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 138 covers lambda, api_gateway, iam, cold_start at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Response Schema

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Response Schema** for `AWS Lambda Serverless Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 138 covers lambda, api_gateway, iam, cold_start at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Error Codes

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Error Codes** for `AWS Lambda Serverless Patterns` (api_reference). This variant 138 covers lambda, api_gateway, iam, cold_start at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS aws_138 (
    id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    topic       TEXT NOT NULL,
    variant     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 138,
    payload     JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_aws_138_topic ON aws_138 (topic);

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT id, topic, payload FROM aws_138
WHERE topic = 'aws_lambda' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
