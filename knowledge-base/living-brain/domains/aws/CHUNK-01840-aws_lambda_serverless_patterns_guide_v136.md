# AWS Lambda Serverless Patterns — Guide (v136)

## Overview

In practice, **Overview** for `AWS Lambda Serverless Patterns` (guide). This variant 136 covers lambda, api_gateway, iam, cold_start at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Prerequisites
