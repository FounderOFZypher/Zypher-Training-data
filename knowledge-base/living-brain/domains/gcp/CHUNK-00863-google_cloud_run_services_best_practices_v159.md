# Google Cloud Run Services — Best Practices (v159)

## Principles

When integrating with legacy systems, **Principles** for `Google Cloud Run Services` (best_practices). This variant 159 covers cloud_run, gke, iam, autoscaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

When integrating with legacy systems, **Do** for `Google Cloud Run Services` (best_practices). This variant 159 covers cloud_run, gke, iam, autoscaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

When integrating with legacy systems, **Don't** for `Google Cloud Run Services` (best_practices). This variant 159 covers cloud_run, gke, iam, autoscaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class GcpCloudRun:
    """Google Cloud Run Services"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "gcp_cloud_run", "variant": 159}
```
