# Rust Ownership in Systems Programming — Best Practices (v78)

## Principles

For security-sensitive deployments, **Principles** for `Rust Ownership in Systems Programming` (best_practices). This variant 78 covers ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, safety at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

For security-sensitive deployments, **Do** for `Rust Ownership in Systems Programming` (best_practices). This variant 78 covers ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, safety at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

For security-sensitive deployments, **Don't** for `Rust Ownership in Systems Programming` (best_practices). This variant 78 covers ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, safety at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Checklist

## Reference Implementation

```rust
pub struct RustOwnership {
    pub topic: String,
    pub variant: u32,
}

impl RustOwnership {
    pub fn process(&self) -> serde_json::Value {
        serde_json::json!({"status": "ok", "topic": self.topic, "variant": self.variant})
    }
}
```
