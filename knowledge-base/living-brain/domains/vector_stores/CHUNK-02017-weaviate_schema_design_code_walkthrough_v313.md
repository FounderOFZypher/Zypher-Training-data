# Weaviate Schema Design — Code Walkthrough (v313)

## Problem

For production systems, **Problem** for `Weaviate Schema Design` (code_walkthrough). This variant 313 covers weaviate, schema, multi_tenancy, hybrid at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface WeaviateSchemaConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleWeaviateSchema(config: WeaviateSchemaConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
