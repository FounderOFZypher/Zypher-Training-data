# Weaviate Schema Design — Benchmark (v314)

## Suite

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Suite** for `Weaviate Schema Design` (benchmark). This variant 314 covers weaviate, schema, multi_tenancy, hybrid at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Methodology** for `Weaviate Schema Design` (benchmark). This variant 314 covers weaviate, schema, multi_tenancy, hybrid at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

When scaling to enterprise workloads, **Dataset** for `Weaviate Schema Design` (benchmark). This variant 314 covers weaviate, schema, multi_tenancy, hybrid at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Weaviate Schema Design benchmark variant 314.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.80 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 4830 |
| error rate | 0.3150 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class WeaviateSchema:
    """Weaviate Schema Design"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "weaviate_schema", "variant": 314}
```
