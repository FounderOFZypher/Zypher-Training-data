# Pinecone Vector Index Management — Guide (v289)

## Overview

For production systems, **Overview** for `Pinecone Vector Index Management` (guide). This variant 289 covers pinecone, namespaces, metadata, upsert at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
