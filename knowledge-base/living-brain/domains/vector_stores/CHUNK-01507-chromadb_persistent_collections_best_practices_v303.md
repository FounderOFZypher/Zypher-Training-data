# ChromaDB Persistent Collections — Best Practices (v303)

## Principles

When integrating with legacy systems, **Principles** for `ChromaDB Persistent Collections` (best_practices). This variant 303 covers chromadb, collections, persistence, embedding at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Do

When integrating with legacy systems, **Do** for `ChromaDB Persistent Collections` (best_practices). This variant 303 covers chromadb, collections, persistence, embedding at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Don't

When integrating with legacy systems, **Don't** for `ChromaDB Persistent Collections` (best_practices). This variant 303 covers chromadb, collections, persistence, embedding at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class ChromadbPersistence:
    """ChromaDB Persistent Collections"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "chromadb_persistence", "variant": 303}
```
