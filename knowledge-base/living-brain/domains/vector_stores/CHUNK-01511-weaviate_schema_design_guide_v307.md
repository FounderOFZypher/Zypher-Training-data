# Weaviate Schema Design — Guide (v307)

## Overview

From first principles, **Overview** for `Weaviate Schema Design` (guide). This variant 307 covers weaviate, schema, multi_tenancy, hybrid at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.

## Reference Implementation

```python
from typing import Any

class WeaviateSchema:
    """Weaviate Schema Design"""

    def __init__(self, config: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self._config = config

    def process(self, payload: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return {"status": "ok", "topic": "weaviate_schema", "variant": 307}
```
