# Neural Synapse: observability_stack → graphrag_engine

Cross-domain connection in the Coltex Living Brain graph.

## Connection type
**calls** — documents in `observability_stack` calls into `graphrag_engine`.

## Source hub
- Hub: `observability_stack`
- Anchor: `HUB-OBSERVABILITY_STACK`

## Target hub
- Hub: `graphrag_engine`
- Anchor: `HUB-GRAPHRAG_ENGINE`

## Traversal hint
When querying either domain, GraphRAG expansion follows this synapse for multi-hop context.

## Coltex brain note
Synapses are first-class graph edges. The retrieval pipeline uses `see_also` and `depends_on`
to surface related knowledge across domain boundaries.
