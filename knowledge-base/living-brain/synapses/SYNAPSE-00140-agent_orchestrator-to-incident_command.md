# Neural Synapse: agent_orchestrator → incident_command

Cross-domain connection in the Coltex Living Brain graph.

## Connection type
**see_also** — documents in `agent_orchestrator` is related to `incident_command`.

## Source hub
- Hub: `agent_orchestrator`
- Anchor: `HUB-AGENT_ORCHESTRATOR`

## Target hub
- Hub: `incident_command`
- Anchor: `HUB-INCIDENT_COMMAND`

## Traversal hint
When querying either domain, GraphRAG expansion follows this synapse for multi-hop context.

## Coltex brain note
Synapses are first-class graph edges. The retrieval pipeline uses `see_also` and `depends_on`
to surface related knowledge across domain boundaries.
