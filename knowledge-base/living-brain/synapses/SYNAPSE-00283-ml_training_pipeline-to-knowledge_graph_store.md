# Neural Synapse: ml_training_pipeline → knowledge_graph_store

Cross-domain connection in the Coltex Living Brain graph.

## Connection type
**depends_on** — documents in `ml_training_pipeline` depends on `knowledge_graph_store`.

## Source hub
- Hub: `ml_training_pipeline`
- Anchor: `HUB-ML_TRAINING_PIPELINE`

## Target hub
- Hub: `knowledge_graph_store`
- Anchor: `HUB-KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_STORE`

## Traversal hint
When querying either domain, GraphRAG expansion follows this synapse for multi-hop context.

## Coltex brain note
Synapses are first-class graph edges. The retrieval pipeline uses `see_also` and `depends_on`
to surface related knowledge across domain boundaries.
