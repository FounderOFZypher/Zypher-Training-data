# Neural Synapse: knowledge_graph_store → rag_retrieval_core

Cross-domain connection in the Coltex Living Brain graph.

## Connection type
**calls** — documents in `knowledge_graph_store` calls into `rag_retrieval_core`.

## Source hub
- Hub: `knowledge_graph_store`
- Anchor: `HUB-KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_STORE`

## Target hub
- Hub: `rag_retrieval_core`
- Anchor: `HUB-RAG_RETRIEVAL_CORE`

## Traversal hint
When querying either domain, GraphRAG expansion follows this synapse for multi-hop context.

## Coltex brain note
Synapses are first-class graph edges. The retrieval pipeline uses `see_also` and `depends_on`
to surface related knowledge across domain boundaries.
