# Neural Synapse: rag_retrieval_core → security_operations

Cross-domain connection in the Coltex Living Brain graph.

## Connection type
**documents** — documents in `rag_retrieval_core` documents `security_operations`.

## Source hub
- Hub: `rag_retrieval_core`
- Anchor: `HUB-RAG_RETRIEVAL_CORE`

## Target hub
- Hub: `security_operations`
- Anchor: `HUB-SECURITY_OPERATIONS`

## Traversal hint
When querying either domain, GraphRAG expansion follows this synapse for multi-hop context.

## Coltex brain note
Synapses are first-class graph edges. The retrieval pipeline uses `see_also` and `depends_on`
to surface related knowledge across domain boundaries.
