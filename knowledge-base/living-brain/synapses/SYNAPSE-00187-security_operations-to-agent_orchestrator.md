# Neural Synapse: security_operations → agent_orchestrator

Cross-domain connection in the Coltex Living Brain graph.

## Connection type
**see_also** — documents in `security_operations` is related to `agent_orchestrator`.

## Source hub
- Hub: `security_operations`
- Anchor: `HUB-SECURITY_OPERATIONS`

## Target hub
- Hub: `agent_orchestrator`
- Anchor: `HUB-AGENT_ORCHESTRATOR`

## Traversal hint
When querying either domain, GraphRAG expansion follows this synapse for multi-hop context.

## Coltex brain note
Synapses are first-class graph edges. The retrieval pipeline uses `see_also` and `depends_on`
to surface related knowledge across domain boundaries.
