# Neural Synapse: incident_command → indexing_pipeline

Cross-domain connection in the Coltex Living Brain graph.

## Connection type
**documents** — documents in `incident_command` documents `indexing_pipeline`.

## Source hub
- Hub: `incident_command`
- Anchor: `HUB-INCIDENT_COMMAND`

## Target hub
- Hub: `indexing_pipeline`
- Anchor: `HUB-INDEXING_PIPELINE`

## Traversal hint
When querying either domain, GraphRAG expansion follows this synapse for multi-hop context.

## Coltex brain note
Synapses are first-class graph edges. The retrieval pipeline uses `see_also` and `depends_on`
to surface related knowledge across domain boundaries.
