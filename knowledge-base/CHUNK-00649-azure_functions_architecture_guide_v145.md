# Azure Functions Architecture — Guide (v145)

## Overview

For production systems, **Overview** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (guide). This variant 145 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Prerequisites

For production systems, **Prerequisites** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (guide). This variant 145 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Core Concepts

For production systems, **Core Concepts** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (guide). This variant 145 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Implementation Steps

For production systems, **Implementation Steps** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (guide). This variant 145 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Validation

For production systems, **Validation** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (guide). This variant 145 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Next Steps

For production systems, **Next Steps** for `Azure Functions Architecture` (guide). This variant 145 covers functions, app_service, monitoring, scaling at intermediate level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Reference Implementation

```typescript
interface AzureFunctionsConfig {
  topic: string;
  variant: number;
}

export async function handleAzureFunctions(config: AzureFunctionsConfig): Promise<Record<string, unknown>> {
  return { status: "ok", topic: config.topic, variant: config.variant };
}
```
