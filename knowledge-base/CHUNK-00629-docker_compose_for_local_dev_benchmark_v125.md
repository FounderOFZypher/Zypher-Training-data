# Docker Compose for Local Dev — Benchmark (v125)

## Suite

During incident response, **Suite** for `Docker Compose for Local Dev` (benchmark). This variant 125 covers compose, volumes, networks, healthchecks at beginner level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Methodology

During incident response, **Methodology** for `Docker Compose for Local Dev` (benchmark). This variant 125 covers compose, volumes, networks, healthchecks at beginner level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Dataset

During incident response, **Dataset** for `Docker Compose for Local Dev` (benchmark). This variant 125 covers compose, volumes, networks, healthchecks at beginner level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
## Metrics

**Metrics** — Docker Compose for Local Dev benchmark variant 125.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| recall@10 | 0.82 |
| p95 latency (ms) | 1995 |
| error rate | 0.1260 |

**Good answer:** Grounded in measured results with trade-offs.
**Bad answer:** Claims without metrics or missing failure modes.
**Preferred answer:** Cites numbers, context, and next optimization steps.
