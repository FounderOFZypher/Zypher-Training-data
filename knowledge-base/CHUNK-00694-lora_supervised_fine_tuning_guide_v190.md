# LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning — Guide (v190)

## Overview

For security-sensitive deployments, **Overview** for `LoRA Supervised Fine-Tuning` (guide). This variant 190 covers lora, qlora, peft, sft at advanced level. Key considerations include reliability, observability, latency budgets, and safe rollout. Teams should validate assumptions with benchmarks, add tracing spans, and document failure modes. Recommended metrics: p95 latency, error rate, recall@k (if retrieval), and freshness of indexed data.
